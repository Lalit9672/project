          <span>Proposal Invited for Special Forums</span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Journal of Indian Research invites proposals for Special Forums in
        upcoming issues. Each Special Forum will be a cluster of articles on a
        critical issue presented by various scholars from around the world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Each Special Forum proposal should include: (1) a cover note that
        briefly explains the significance of the special focus and introduces
        the prospective guest editors (2) a draft of the call for papers for the
        Special Forum (450-word limit).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If the Special Forum proposal is accepted, the forumâ€™s guest editors
        will send out the call for papers, field all submission queries, and
        follow Journal of Indian Research procedures for a peer review process.
      </p>
